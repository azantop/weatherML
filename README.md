# weatherML -  Weather prediction based on historical data
Timeseries Learning with Physics Informed Neural Networks on multivariate weather data for multi-step forecasts!  

We use the meteostat library to access wordwide hourly and daily historical weather data.  
We may retrieve single stations or weighted averages for arbitrary geographic coordinates.  

For this project, we load corresponding data on a rectengular 10x10 grid over Europe.
Data processing interpolates missing values (sometimes a stations miss a measurement)
from nearby stations.
